# UnitConverter

The goal of this project is to program a basic python unit convertor like CM to M, M to CM, CM to KM etc. People use unit converters everyday due to many reasons like convenience, accuracy, and education. It may be easier to understand a measurement in a different unit, or you may be more familiar with a particular unit system
